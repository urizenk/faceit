     * @implNote This implementation is a stable, adaptive, iterative mergesort that
     * requires far fewer than n lg(n) comparisons when the input array is
     * partially sorted, while offering the performance of a traditional
     * mergesort when the input array is randomly ordered.  If the input array
     * is nearly sorted, the implementation requires approximately n
     * comparisons.  Temporary storage requirements vary from a small constant
     * for nearly sorted input arrays to n/2 object references for randomly
     * ordered input arrays.
     *
     * <p>The implementation takes equal advantage of ascending and
     * descending order in its input array, and can take advantage of
     * ascending and descending order in different parts of the same
     * input array.  It is well-suited to merging two or more sorted arrays:
     * simply concatenate the arrays and sort the resulting array.
     *
     * <p>The implementation was adapted from Tim Peters's list sort for Python
     * (<a href="http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt">
     * TimSort</a>).  It uses techniques from Peter McIlroy's "Optimistic
     * Sorting and Information Theoretic Complexity", in Proceedings of the
     * Fourth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp 467-474,
     * January 1993.
